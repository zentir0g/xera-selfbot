5. **Handle Windows Defender**:
   - **Why It’s Flagged**: Xera Selfbot might be flagged by Windows Defender because it is built using **PyInstaller**, a tool that packages Python scripts into executable files. PyInstaller is often flagged by antivirus software because it bundles multiple dependencies, which can sometimes trigger false positives.
   - **How to Allow It**:
     - Open **Windows Security**.
     - Go to **Virus & threat protection**.
     - Click on **Protection history**.
     - Find the flagged `xera.exe` and select **Allow on device**.
     - Alternatively, you can temporarily disable Windows Defender to run the selfbot. To do this, go to **Virus & threat protection settings** and turn off **Real-time protection**.

6. **Enjoy**: Once the selfbot is running, you can start using the commands listed in the help menu.
